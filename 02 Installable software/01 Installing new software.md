This process started on request from the user via the Software Installation page.is automated. After it has started it can take anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes to set up and complete. Please be patient while this process <br>
<br>
<strong>Important note:</strong> Occasionally the installer does not complete, meaning the &quot;You have requested...&quot; dialogue never gets updated. In this case you can:<br>
<br>
<strong>1:</strong> Re install it using the Install software page. This will just restart the process and fixes the issue 99% of the time. This is a common recommendation for troubleshooting installer issues.<br>
<br>
If that does not work then:<br>
<br>
<strong>2:</strong> Open a&nbsp; support ticket and use a relevant ticket title. Do not use a title like &quot;HELP!!!&quot; as is not particularly useful to staff in accessing your problems or needs at a glance.<br>
<br>
If this still does not work, open a <a href="https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/tickets/new">support ticket</a> and things will be sorted out manually.<br>
<br>
<strong>Important Note:</strong> If you have just received your slot, please allow some extra time for things to work, even after the process has show to be completed.<br>
