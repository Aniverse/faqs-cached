<h1>Can I run a Tor node on my slot?</h1>

        
<strong>No</strong>.&nbsp; We do not allow Tor exit nodes to be run on our servers. They&#x27;re open invitations for trouble, and while Tor serves a useful purpose our network is not the place for it.<br>
<br>
Tor relays are fine provided they strictly only act as an intermediary.<br>
<br>
We will make an exception to this rule if you bring your own RIPE IPs and handle abuse directly while taking full responsibility.
