<h1>CuteFTP - Continue downloading a file that I&#x27;ve removed from the queue</h1>

        
Lets say you&#x27;ve downloaded 10% of a file and you&#x27;ve removed it from the queue and now you want to continue the download. Here&#x27;s how you do it.<br>
<br>
First you&#x27;ll need that 10% file.<br>
<br>
After that, go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Transfer - Smart Overwrite.<br>
<br>
It will say &quot; Matching file or folder name handling &quot; at the top (under the blue box). In the drop-down menu box called &quot; For matching files: &quot; choose Resume.<br>
<br>
If it&#x27;s a single file you need to continue, you&#x27;re done.<br>
<br>
If you want to continue a complete folder, choose &quot; Use Rules &quot; in the drop down-menu called &quot; For matching folders: &quot;. After that click on the button below the drop-down menus called &quot; Configure Rules &quot;.<br>
<br>
There are 4 drop-down menus here, choose &quot; no matter &quot; in the first two, then in the third, choose &quot; any transfer &quot;, in the fourth choose &quot; resume &quot;, then click on &quot; ADD &gt;&gt; &quot;. You can then add more options if you want.<br>
<br>
After that localize your files on the server and you local HDD. After that you can download it as usual and it should start at 10%.<br>
