<h1>How to move data between two servers in windows</h1>

        
Moving data between two servers with FTP without downloading it to your local computer first is called an <em>FXP transfer</em>. For you to be able to transfer data this way, FXP mode must be enabled on both servers â€” the server you are transferring to and the one you are transferring from. FXP is enabled on your Feral server by default.<br>
<br>
You need your login details to both servers. You can find your Feral access details on your <a href="https://www.feralhosting.com/heron/manager/software/">Software Status page</a>. Make sure you use the drop-down box to switch between different servers.<br>
<br>
Download <a href="http://www.ftprush.com/download.html">FTPRush</a> for example, open it and it will look like this:<br>
<br>
Now you have two windows open: on the right you see your local data, and on left you see a blank window. Now go to Tools &gt; Site Manager &gt; Click &quot;Sites&quot; &gt; File &gt; New &gt; New Site &gt; Type the name for your first site and press OK. Now put your login in this window and click OK.<br>
<br>
Now do the same for that other server as well.<br>
<br>
Now switch from local view to remote using this button:<br>
<br>
Now connect to both of those servers and go to your torrent clients data folder: <br>
<br>
Now choose all folders and files and just drag-and-drop them into that other window (server) and it will start fxp&#x27;ing the files right away.<br>
<br>
<strong>Important note:</strong> It is not possible to transfer files between FTP and SFTP servers, or between two SFTP servers.
