<br>
Shortly after you complete your registration with the Feral Hosting website you will receive an email containing your username along with a secure and randomly generated password. You can now log into your Feral hosting account and order a slot!<br>
<br>
<h2>Slot Availability</h2><br>
The <a href="https://www.feralhosting.com/pricing">pricing page</a> gives an accurate total of the number of accounts that can be set up instantly. Providing that there are an adequate number or free slots available when you order your slot.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of the pricing page where all available slots have been exhausted:<br>
<br>

<br>
If there are no slots available in a product type, it will display: <br>
<br>
<pre><code>0* available</code></pre><br>
In this case you are put into a queue and your slot will be automatically provisioned to you when more become available. This process is automated and it is not biased by the type of plan selected.<br>
<br>
<h2>Ordering and Instant set-up</h2><br>
Set up times are quoted as instant, but this is completely dependent on funds actually being transferred to us, not the completion of the payment process. The system is automated so as soon as we actually receive the funds the payment process completes and the slot is created. You are then notified by email that your slot is ready to use.<br>
<br>
If you are <strong>NOT</strong> a UK resident you may have to allow for international payments to be processed with your credit card provider. This is in case it the transaction gets flagged as potentially fraudulent. Also, if this is your first payment to Feral, your credit provider may have checks in place to protect you against irregular transactions. These are factors which are <strong>outside of Feral&#x27;s control</strong> and we must wait until the transaction clears and payment is received before the slot can be created. You can phone your bank or credit card provider to find out more.<br>
<br>
<strong>Important note:</strong> You will be sent an email to notify you that your slot has been provisioned and is now accessible.<br>
