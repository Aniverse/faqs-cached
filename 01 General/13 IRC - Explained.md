<h1>IRC - Explained</h1>

        
The Feral IRC channel is kindly hosted on the <code>irc.what-network.net</code>. We abide by and enforce their Global server rules.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Important note:</strong> We are guests on the <code>what-network</code> and must respect their global IRC rules as well as our channel specific rules. Here are the combined rule you will need to know.<br>
<br>
<code>#feral</code> is an English language channel. Please try to use English when asking your questions.<br>
<br>
The majority of Staff in <code>#feral</code> are in UK or Western European time zones and you should consider this when looking for a response from staff in IRC. We would recommend you <a href="https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/tickets/new">open a ticket</a> if the concern is urgent.<br>
<br>
Here are the golden rules.<br>
<br>
<strong>1:</strong> The offering, selling, trading, and giving away of invites to this or any other site on our IRC network is strictly forbidden.<br>
<br>
<strong>2:</strong> No prejudice, especially related to race, religion, politics, ethnic background, etc. It is highly suggested to avoid these topics entirely.<br>
<br>
<strong>3:</strong> Spamming is strictly forbidden. This includes, but is not limited to, personal sites, on-line auctions, and torrent uploads.<br>
<br>
<strong>4:</strong> Do not PM, DCC, or Query anyone you don&#x27;t know or have never talked to without asking first; this applies specifically to staff.<br>
<br>
<strong>5:</strong> Communicate with other people in a respectable manner at all times, regardless of the perceived importance of your issue.<br>
<br>
<strong>6:</strong> Please ask your question clearly and with as much detail as you can provide so that other users and staff may better help you. Don&#x27;t be vague or ask to ask questions.<br>
<br>
Please read the channel topic before asking your questions as it usually contains relative information to any known issues.<br>
<br>
All known and ongoing issues will be listed on the Status page - <a href="https://status.feral.io/">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.feral.io&#x2F;</a><br>
<br>
<h2>IRC</h2><br>
Tickets are the primary means of support at Feral hosting. If you have a payment, billing or personal query we cannot discuss that with you over IRC and you will be asked to create a ticket. If your issue falls under one of the categories mentioned then <a href="https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/tickets/">open a ticket</a><br>
<br>
<code>rTorrent</code> (The main application running on the slot) &#x2F; <code>rutorrent</code> (The Web Interface for rTorrent)<br>
<code>deluge</code> (The main application running on the slot) &#x2F; <code>deluge-web</code> (The Web Interface for deluge)<br>
<code>transmission</code> (The main application running on the slot) &#x2F; <code>transmission-web</code> (The Web Interface for Transmission)<br>
<code>mysql</code> The local MySQL installation provided from the Account Manager.<br>
<code>openvpn</code> The OpenVPN credentials and supported access (one active connection per Slot)<br>
<br>
IRC is to be considered primarily as community support for a wide range of issues.&nbsp; Staff will directly support any issues relating to the services provided with a purchased slot. What does directly support mean? This means where we will go out of our way to ensure your Slot and included services are functional and fulfilling their intended function.<br>
<br>
<h3>What to expect in IRC:</h3><br>
You can expect the general help and support of other very knowledgeable users and Staff for a wide range of issues when these people are able to do so. Staff are users too and we like to help out other users where possible.<br>
<br>
Very often the problem a user has doesn&#x27;t actually require Staff&#x27;s attention and they can be supported by other users in the channel using their knowledge and the wide range of FAQs and guides we have in the Feral FAQs. You will find these linked to often in the responses given to your issue.<br>
<br>
There has been a lot of effort put into the FAQs by&nbsp; many Feral users over the years that enables you to support yourself without relying on Staff. Do not think that you being given a FAQ link to help you with your issue is the equivalent of your issue being dismissed. This could not be further from the truth.<br>
<br>
<h3>What not to expect in IRC:</h3><br>
We take your privacy very seriously so we cannot discuss or process accounts issues or tickets via IRC as we cannot verify people are who they claim to be. If this is the case you will be directed to open a support ticket.<br>
<br>
Other things you can expect us not to do in IRC:<br>
<br>
Discuss your account information or tickets with you.<br>
Leap frog your issue to the front of the ticket queue.<br>
Process your ticket faster for creating a fuss about it.<br>
<br>

<h2>Register your IRC nickname with Nickserv</h2><br>
If you wish to &quot;reserve&quot; your nickname so others may not use it, you need to register your desired nickname with NickServ.<br>
<br>
The first time you join the What-Network IRC network, you will want to register your nickname with NickServ. To do this, type:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>&#x2F;msg NickServ REGISTER PASSWORD EMAIL</code></pre><br>
Replacing PASSWORD with any password you wish, and EMAIL with a real email address (in case you need to reset your password).<br>
<br>
If the command completes successfully, NickServ will protect your nick by requiring a password when you attempt to use it.<br>
<br>
The next time you log into IRC, you won&#x27;t be automatically recognized by the NickServ system. You will need to identify yourself to the server. You do this by typing:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>&#x2F;msg NickServ IDENTIFY PASSWORD</code></pre><br>
If you want to be automatically identified when you open your client, you will have to set up commands to be run. Each client has its own way, but mIRC will let you do it in Tools &gt; Options &gt; Connect &gt; Options &gt; Perform<br>
When you have this window open, make sure to &quot;enable perform on connect&quot;, and enter the commands to be run in the biggest box below.<br>
<br>
This is everything you need to know about using IRC.<br>
If you have trouble with the NickServ system, type:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>&#x2F;msg NickServ HELP</code></pre><br>
This command will explain how to use the NickServ service.<br>
<br>
<h2>Who is Who in IRC?</h2><br>
<code>_Lemon_</code> is Joshua, denoted by the <code>~</code>, orange dot (hexchat) or House symbol (mibbit) in before his name in IRC. This is the owner of Feral Hosting and the person you may be most familiar with from your tickets.<br>
<br>
Anybody denoted with a <code>@</code>, green dot (hexchat) or a full gold star (mibbit) in front of their name are Feral staff and will support your issue in the most appropriate way. Which means sometimes directing you to open a ticket as your issue cannot be discussed in IRC.<br>
<br>
People with <code>%</code>, turquoise dot (hexchat) or half gold star (mibbit) or <code>+</code>,&nbsp; blue dot (hexchat) or speaker symbol (mibbit) are respected users who have shown their commitment to helping other users in IRC and have volunteered their time and services in accordance with the volunteering section of this FAQ.<br>
