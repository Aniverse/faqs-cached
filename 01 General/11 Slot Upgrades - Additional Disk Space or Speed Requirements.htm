    <h1>Slot Upgrades - Additional Disk Space or Speed Requirements</h1>
    <div class="wallOfText">
        
            <strong>Important note:</strong> This procedure applies to moving or downgrading slots as well.<br>
<br>
An upgraded slot is a larger one. For example, doubling a Neon slot is known as a Krypton as it offers twice the disk space.<br>
<br>
You do not need to register a separate account for an upgrade unless you wish to change your feral username. <br>
<br>
In this case you will need to register a new username and account and purchase the slot as that new user. <br>
<br>
To upgrade or move your slot please:<br>
<br>
<strong>1:</strong> Purchase the slot from our website.<br>
<br>
<strong>2:</strong> Wait until you receive the slot.<br>
<br>
<strong>3:</strong> Then open a ticket requesting a data transfer (optional)<br>
<br>
<strong>4:</strong> Request a refund on your current slot (optional).<br>
