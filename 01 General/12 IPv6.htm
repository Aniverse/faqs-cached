    <h1>IPv6</h1>
    <div class="wallOfText">
        
            We have begun testing IPv6 on our network and have introduced it to our servers. It runs alongside IPv4 and most of the time, will pick quietly whichever version is available.<br>
<br>
The following services should be available: HTTP, FTP, SSH (including SFTP and SOCKS proxies) and DNS.<br>
<br>
IPv6 is important as there is an <a href="https://www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/news/announcements/ripe-ncc-begins-to-allocate-ipv4-address-space-from-the-last-8">IP shortage</a> preventing everyone from connecting to the Internet. Those most hit by this are providers such as ourselves who are relatively small and late to the IP-game; we are limited to 1,024 IPs for life. IPv6 allows us to expand this to practically, as many as required.<br>
<br>
Once IPv6 is fully tested on our services, IPv6 will perform better than IPv4. In addition, if you only have a IPv4 address, you can get access IPv6 services by using a tunnel broker; then, if a particular broker causes speed issues, you can choose another.<br>
<br>
This effectively allows you to actively workaround routing or congestion issues.<br>
<br>
<h2>Getting connected</h2><br>
To get connected via IPv6 you should first check to see if your ISP supports IPv6. Some ISP have begun rolling it out in a usable form.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tunnel brokers</h2><br>
If your ISP does not offer any support for IPv6 then a tunnel broker can be set up instead. Tunnels are a way of sending IPv6 traffic over IPv4 but provides the flexibility of choosing which tunnel offers the best speeds.<br>
<br>
Here are a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokers">tunnel brokers</a>:<br>
<br>
<h3>Freenet6 (gogo6): </h3><br>

<br>
* Multiple locations spread out across the world for alternative connectivity.<br>
* Client is a simple download and run.<br>
* Website is difficult to navigate.<br>
<br>
<h3>SixXS: </h3><br>
<a href="https://www.sixxs.net/main/">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sixxs.net&#x2F;main&#x2F;</a><br>
<br>
* Provides a step-by-step guide (with pictures): <a href="https://www.sixxs.net/faq/account/?faq=10steps">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sixxs.net&#x2F;faq&#x2F;account&#x2F;?faq=10steps</a><br>
* Many locations available for alternative connectivity.<br>
* Requires a waiting period of at least a week to get activated.<br>
<br>
<h3>Hurricane Electric: </h3><br>
<a href="https://tunnelbroker.net/">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tunnelbroker.net&#x2F;</a><br>
<br>
* Tier 1 ISP who are providing us with IPv6 connectivity.<br>
* No activation time.<br>
* Requires your router to forward protocol 41.<br>
<br>
These services are essentially providing a free proxy to promote and increase IPv6 connectivity. They do ask for a lot of information prior to the set up to help avoid abuse of their service.<br>
<br>
<h2>Welcome to the future</h2><br>
By connecting to IPv6 you greatly help us and the wider Internet out. In the future, IPv6 set up will be faster than IPv4.<br>
<br>
Please let us know if you run into problems (setting up, poor speeds, etc) and we&#x27;ll try to help.<br>
